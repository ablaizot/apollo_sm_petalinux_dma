				internally by this tool, however advance user can use this to
				mark image A and B as bootable or non bootable. Also advance
				user can tell the system to boot which image (A/B) on next power
				cycle. This section also shows name of the last image
				successfully booted.

				Recover Image
			</p>

			<p style="font-size: 20px">
				This section allows user to upload the new image from the user
				computer to system board. User should first select new bootable image
				by clicking on Browse button and selecting the file to be
				uploaded. User can overwrite either image A or image B.
				This tool allows user to upload image one at a time. By default
				system selects the image other than last successfully
				booted image to update automatically. So even if upload fails,
				system will have last successfully booted image as a backup.
				If user want to upload new image to overwrite both images A and
				B, he/she should upload it twice by appropriately selecting the
				image to be updated using radio button provided.

				On clicking Upload button, system asks for confirmation for
				upload and if user confirm upload, it shows the prpogress of the
				impage upload in progress bar. Test under upload shows steps
				getting executed to upload the new image. Once image is
				successfully uploaded, power cycle the system to get new image
				booted.
